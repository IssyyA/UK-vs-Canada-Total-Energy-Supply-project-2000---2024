# ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ UK vs Canada Energy Analysis (2000â€“2024)

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **total energy supply** of the **United Kingdom** and **Canada** from **2000 to 2024**, comparing how two advanced economies have approached decarbonization under very different geographic and resource conditions.

Unlike studies focused solely on electricity generation, this analysis considers the **entire energy system** â€” including transport, heating, and industrial energy use. The goal is to understand how both countriesâ€™ total energy demand, fossil fuel dependency, and renewable adoption have evolved over time.

The Dataset used to clean, group, and analyze the data can be found[here](https://1drv.ms/f/c/9456734e419f9736/EvYmzbazDT9Nk6G-11IlQYsB35kcVCT2bhbm5OKBsH7ulA?e=iVHt3s)
The Power BI dashboard visualizes the data, allowing users to explore key metrics such as total production, fossil fuel share, renewable energy share and energy mix across both nations. The dashboard is available [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjc3N2E2ODctOGE2Ni00N2E0LWFlNTItZTkwOWI5M2Y4N2NiIiwidCI6ImMwM2MxNjIyLTBmYmEtNDQwYi05YWYxLWM4MzhkY2YxZTM2NyJ9)

## Insights and Focus Areas  

The analysis explores four main dimensions:

- **Category 1:** Total Energy Supply Trends (2000â€“2024)  
- **Category 2:** Fossil Fuel Dependency and Efficiency  
- **Category 3:** Growth of Renewable Energy Share  
- **Category 4:** Comparative Energy Mix by Source  

The dashboard provides an interactive side-by-side view of the UK and Canada, with visual storytelling around energy mix evolution.

## Dataset Description  

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| Country | United Kingdom, Canada |
| Year | 2000â€“2024 |
| Energy Source | Coal, Oil, Natural Gas, Nuclear, Hydro, Biofuels, Solar/Wind, etc. |
| Production (TJ) | Total production by source (terajoules) |
| Fossil Fuel Share (%) | Combined share of coal, oil, and gas |
| Renewables Share (%) | Combined share of hydro, solar, wind, and biofuels |

The dataset is based on the **IEA Total Energy Supply** records, covering all major energy categories and sources over a 25-year period.

## Executive Summary  

### ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ United Kingdom â€” *The Great Decoupling*  
- **Total energy demand declined by 36%**, from 8.5M to 5.9M TJ, even as GDP grew.  
- **Renewables share rose from 1% to 16.8%**, led by offshore wind.  
- **Fossil fuels now account for 75.7%** of total energy, but in **absolute terms**, fossil use has fallen dramatically.  
- The UK achieved one of the rarest global outcomes: **economic growth with falling total energy demand**.

### ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Canada â€” *The Clean Energy Add-On*  
- **Total energy demand grew by 16%**, reaching 12.4M TJ.  
- **Renewables share increased to 34.2%**, mostly from hydro and new wind/solar capacity.  
- **Fossil fuel share (76.2%)** remained almost unchanged, meaning clean energy was **added** rather than **substituted**.  
- Canada expanded its total energy pie, reflecting its status as a resource-rich, export-driven economy.

## Overview of Findings  

- The **UK** demonstrates a model of **efficiency-led decarbonization**, reducing both energy use and fossil dependence.  
- **Canada** represents a **growth-based model**, adding renewables without reducing fossil fuel use.  
- **Hydropower** gives Canada a natural renewable advantage, while the UKâ€™s strength lies in **offshore wind innovation**.  
- The analysis highlights how **decarbonizing electricity** differs from **decarbonizing total energy** â€” Canadaâ€™s fossil total rose even as renewables expanded.

## Insights Deep Dive  

### Category 1: Total Energy Supply Trends  
- UK energy supply peaked in the early 2000s, then steadily declined due to efficiency and industrial shifts.  
- Canadaâ€™s supply rose overall, driven by oil sands expansion and population growth.

### Category 2: Fossil Fuel Dependency and Efficiency  
- The UK cut fossil fuel use by nearly 3 million TJ between 2000 and 2024.  
- Canadaâ€™s fossil use grew slightly in line with overall demand.  
- The UKâ€™s fossil reduction reflects deep structural changes in its economy and energy systems.

### Category 3: Renewable Energy Growth  
- UK renewables grew fifteenfold, led by wind and bioenergy.  
- Canadaâ€™s renewable mix remains dominated by hydro, but wind and solar capacity have risen since 2010.  
- UK growth is **engineered** through innovation; Canadaâ€™s is **resource-driven**.

### Category 4: Energy Mix Composition  
- The UK now shows a balanced mix of nuclear, wind, and bioenergy.  
- Canadaâ€™s mix remains heavily weighted toward hydro and fossil fuels.  
- Each countryâ€™s resource base has defined its transition path.

## Recommendations  

1. **For the UK:**  
   - Continue scaling offshore wind and expand energy storage solutions.  
   - Target further fossil reduction in heating and transport sectors.  

2. **For Canada:**  
   - Implement stronger policies to cap fossil output growth.  
   - Use hydro capacity for hydrogen production and export decarbonization.  

3. **For Both Nations:**  
   - Develop whole-economy energy efficiency frameworks beyond electricity.  
   - Align total energy consumption targets with net-zero strategies.

## Assumptions  

- Data sourced from **IEA Total Energy Supply** datasets.  
- Analysis reflects **total energy use**, not electricity generation alone.  
- Fossil fuel share = coal + oil + natural gas.  
- Renewable share = hydro + wind + solar + biofuels.  
- Economic data used contextually (energy-GDP trends).

## Key Takeaway  

> Geography and natural resources donâ€™t just influence climate strategy â€” they define it.  
>
> The UK proves **efficiency-driven decarbonization** is possible.  
> Canada shows that **abundance of renewables** doesnâ€™t automatically mean less fossil fuel.
